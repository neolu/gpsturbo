# gpsturbo - documentation

1) gpsturbo uses the kgui library so you need to compile and build it first. The kgui library
   needs to be at the same level in the directory for example "/source/gpsturbo" and "/source/kgui"

2) build kgui by following the directions in the readme file in the kgui directory


Follow these steps to build gpsturbo

3a) For building using the GNU compiler launch a shell ( use MSYS/Mingw for windows ) and type make

3b) There is also a visual studio solution called "gpsturbo" that you can compile with visual studio.
Note the last build step copies the gpsturbo.exe file to "c:/gpsturbo/gpsturbo.exe" as
it should be run from that directory.
